RISC-V Processor ``drvcpu``
---------------------------

The ``drvcpu`` device encapsulates a RISC-V RV32IMA processor.

Initialization parameters: none
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Commands
^^^^^^^^

``help [cmd]``
   Display a help text for the specified command or a list of available commands.
``info``
   Display the processor configuration
``rd``
   Dump contents of CPU general registers
``csrd [name|number|subcommand]``
   Dump the contents of the specified CSR or some CSRs.
      Dumps contents of predefined CSRs without a parameter.
      Specifying a CSR number or name dump the selected CSR.
      Selecting a subcommand prints one of the following subsets of CSRs:

      - ``mmode`` - dumps all M-mode CSRs
      - ``smode`` - dumps all S-mode CSRs
      - ``counters`` - dumps all counter and counter setup CSRs
      - ``all`` - dumps all CSRs
``tr <addr>``
   Translates the specified virtual address based on the current CPU state and describes the translation process.
      PTEs are dumped in the following format: ``PTE: [ PPN: <ppn> RSW: <rsw> DAGU XWRV]``,
      where ``DAGU`` and ``XWRV`` are either these letters when the corresponding bits are set (i.e. equal to 1),
      or ``-`` when the corresponding bits are clear (i.e. equal to 0).
      Execute ``tlbflush`` before this command when using the TLB for the translation is not desired (but note that flushing the TLB can change the behavior of the simulated program.)
``str <root phys> <addr>``
   Translates the specified virtual address using the pagetable specified by the physical address of its root and describes the translation process.
      Output format is the same as for ``tr``.
      The translation does not use the TLB and ignores the CPU state.
      Note that the root physical address has to be aligned to the size of a page (``4096``).
``ptd [verbose|v]``
   Prints out all valid PTEs in the pagetable currently pointed to by the satp CSR.
   Adding the ``verbose`` parameter (or simply ``v``) prints out all nonzero PTEs.
``sptd <root phys> [verbose|v]``
   Prints out all valid PTEs in the pagetable with its root pagetable located at ``phys`` (physical address).
   Note that this address has to be aligned to the size of a page (``4096``).
   Adding the ``verbose`` parameter (or simply ``v``) prints out all nonzero PTEs.
``tlbd``
   Dump the contents of the TLB, split by page size.
``tlbresize <size>``
   Resize the TLB by specifying its new size.
``tlbflush``
   Removes all entries from the TLB.
``asidlen <length>``
   Changes the bit-length of ASIDs.

   [msim]

Read/write memory ``rwm``
-------------------------

The ``rwm`` device represents a read/write random access memory region.
The memory block could be a general memory or mapped from a file.

Initialization parameters: ``address``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``address``
   Starting physical address of the memory block.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

``help [cmd]``
   Print a help on the command specified of a list of available commands.
``info``
   Print the device information (block address, size and type)
``stat``
   Print device statistics (none).
``generic size``
   Set the size of the memory block.
``fmap filename``
   Map the contents of the memory block from a file specified.
``fill [value]``
   Fill the memory block with zeros or the specified word value.
``load filename``
   Load the contents of the memory block from a file specified.
``save filename``
   Save the contents of the memory block to a file specified.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Example of the ``info`` command.

.. code:: msim

   [msim] startmem info
   start:0x1fc00000 size:1k type:mem
   [msim]

In the following example, the ``add`` command creates a read/write memory
region ``mx`` starting at the physical address 0x00001000.
The size of the region is set to 256Â KB via the ``generic`` command.

.. code:: msim

   [msim] add rwm mx 0x1000
   [msim] mx generic 256k
   [msim]

The content of the read-write memory can be changed as expected from the code
running in the simulator:

.. code:: c

    1 volatile char *p = (char * ) 0x1000;  /* assume 1:1 identity memory mapping */
    2 char c = *p;  /* c contains a byte value read from the address 0x00001000 */
    3 *p += 1;
    4 char d = *p;  /* d contains a byte value read from the address 0x00001001 */




Read-only memory ``rom``
------------------------

The ``rom`` device represents a read-only random access memory region.

Initialization parameters: ``address``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``address``
   Starting physical address of the memory block.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

``help [cmd]``
   Print a help on the command specified or a list of available commands.
``info``
   Print the device information (block address, size and type)
``stat``
   Print device statistics (none).
``generic size``
   Set the size of the memory block.
``fmap filename``
   Map the contents of the memory block from a file specified.
``fill [value]``
   Fill the memory block with zeros or the specified word value.
``load filename``
   Load the contents of the memory block from a file specified.
``save filename``
   Save the contents of the memory block to a file specified.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

In the following example, the ``add`` command creates a read-only memory
region ``mx`` starting at the physical address 0x00001000.
The size of the region is set to 256Â KB via the ``generic`` command.

.. code:: msim

   [msim] add rom mx 0x1000
   [msim] mx generic 256k
   [msim]

All attempts to write into read-only memory are silently ignored.

.. code:: c

    1 volatile char *p = (char * ) 0x1000;  /* assume 1:1 identity memory mapping */
    2 char c = *p;  /* c contains a byte value read from the address 0x00001000 */
    3 *p = ~c;      /* write access is ignored */
    4 char d = *p;  /* c == d */




No-access memory ``dnomem``
---------------------------

The ``dnomem`` device represents a memory region where any reads or writes
terminates with simulation failure.

The device is meant as a debugging aid to ensure our code is not accessing
non-existent memory.

The device operates in three modes. In the default ``warn`` mode, attempts
to access are printed to console but the simulation continues.
In ``break`` mode, the simulation is switched to interactive mode after each
access.
And in ``halt`` mode, the simulation is immediately terminated.

It is possible to dump registers of the CPU that caused the violation
automatically by setting ``rd yes``.


Initialization parameters: ``address`` ``size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``address``
   Starting physical address of the memory block.
``size``
   Memory size.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

``help [cmd]``
   Print a help on the command specified or a list of available commands.
``info``
   Print the device information (block address, size and mode)
``mode``
   Set device mode (either ``warn``, ``halt`` or ``break``).
``rd``
   Whether to dump registers on violation (``yes`` or ``no``).


Examples
^^^^^^^^

In the following example, the ``add`` command creates a protected memory
region ``nomem`` starting at the physical address 0x08000000.
The size of the region is set to 4Â KB.

.. code:: msim

   [msim] add dnomem nomem 0x08000000 0x1000
   [msim]

All attempts to read/write into this memory are reported.

.. code:: asm

    la $a0, 0x88000004
    lw $a1, 0($a0)
    /* <msim> Alert: Ignoring READ (at 0x008000004, 0x4 inside nomem). */

If we configure the device to ``mode`` ``halt``, the simulation is halted upon
reaching the ``lw`` instruction. By using ``nomem rd yes``, registers are
dumped before the machine is halted.

.. code:: msim

   [msim] nomem rd yes
   [msim] nomem mode halt
   [msim]
   # la $a0, 0x88000004
   # lw $a1, 0($a0)
   # <msim> Alert: Halting after forbidden READ (at 0x008000004, 0x4 inside nomem).

     *
     * Configuration file always contains physical addresses as we are
     * configuring the hardware. Here we need to have virtual address
     * as C code cannot access physical addresses directly.
     */
    #define VIDEOADDR 0x90000000

    /* Write one character on the screen. */
    void putchar(char c) {
        *((volatile char *) VIDEOADDR) = c;
    }

    /* Write a NULL-terminated string on the screen. */
    void putstring(char* c) {
        while (*c) {
            *((volatile char *) VIDEOADDR) = *c;
            c++;
        }
    }




Character input device ``dkeyboard``
------------------------------------

The character input device simulates a keyboard connected to the machine.
When a key is pressed, the keyboard asserts an interrupt and the ASCII key
code can be read from the memory-mapped register.
Any read operation on the register automatically deasserts the pending
interrupt.

Initialization parameters: ``address`` ``intno``

   [msim]

Example of the ``stat`` command.

.. code:: msim

   [msim] kb stat
   intrc:11 keycount:11 overrun:0
   [msim]

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The following example adds a new ``dorder`` device named ``order`` and
maps its register on the physical address 0x10000000.

.. code:: msim

   [msim] add dorder order 0x1000000
   [msim]

Simple usage in MIPS code:

.. code:: c

    /* ORDER is the address of the memory-mapped register of dorder.
     * It has to correspond with the definition in the configuration file.
     */
    #define ORDER 0x90000000

    /* Get current CPU identification. */
    unsigned int cpu_id(void) {
        return *((volatile unsigned int *) ORDER);
    }

    /* Send interprocessor interrupt to the given CPU */
    void cpu_send_ipi(unsigned int id) {
        *((volatile unsigned int *) ORDER) = (1 << id);
    }

    /* Send interprocessor interrupt to all CPUs */
    void cpu_send_ipi_all(void) {
        *((volatile unsigned int *) ORDER) = 0xffffffff;
    }

    /* Deassert interprocessor interrupt for the given CPU */
    void cpu_ack_ipi(unsigned int id) {
        *((volatile unsigned int *) (ORDER + 4)) = (1 << id);
    }

Network card device ``dnetcard``
-----------------------------------

The device simulates a network card that has ability to send and receive packets
using DMA for data transfers between the card and memory.

Network card has optional logs which can be turned on using `verbose` variable: ``set verbose``.
This helps to detect some mistakes as connection failure with TCP.

Both DMA buffers have size of 1500, because that is a common MTU.

Supported protocols are UDP and simplified TCP. UDP protocol is fully supported.
Simplified TCP means, that the device sends only TCP data packets to/from the guest.
If the guest initiates a connection by sending a packet to a new address,
the device starts a connection which can be used to transfer the data.
If the connection can not be established, then both TX and ERR interrupts are raised signaling an error with sending packet.
Other features of the TCP protocol are not supported.

Initialization parameters: ``address`` ``intno``

``address``
   Physical address of the networking card register.
``intno``
   DMA Interrupt number.
