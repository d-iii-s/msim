 * Implementation of breakpoints.
 *
 * The simulator supports memory breakpoints for stopping after r/w access
 * to specified address in the memory and code breakpoints for stopping
 * after the specified processor executes instruction on the specified
 * address. (stopping after is probably a wrong behavior, because the gdb
 * expects stopping before the execution of instruction) The memory
 *
 * The memory and code breakpoints have independent implementation. The memory
 * breakpoints implementation resides completely in this module. Addition or
 * removal of code breakpoints is not implemented here, because the code
 * breakpoints list is associated with each processor structure. The code
 * and memory breakpoints have some similar things, which could be united.
 *
 * The memory breakpoints can be currently set only from the simulator.
 * The user of the simulator is notified after the breakpoint hit and
 * then the simulator waits for next commands. They work with physical address.
 *
 * The code breakpoints can be set from a debugger or from the simulator
 * and the handler for breakpoint hit differs according to it. Debugger
 * breakpoint hit is handled by notifying the debugger and waiting for
 * the next command from the debugger. Simulator breakpoint hit is handled
 * by showing message to the user of the simulator and waiting for next command
 * from him. They work with virtual address.
